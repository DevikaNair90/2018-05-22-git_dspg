README files are typically used to tell people what the project is for.

intro to git branching
use ` git branch BRANCH_NAME` or `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` to create  a branch
    - if you use `git branch BRANC_NAME` you also need to run `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`
    - `git branch -b BRANCH_NAME` will create and checkout at the same time

use`git branch -a` to see all your branches`
